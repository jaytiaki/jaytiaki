Tihei mauri ora!

Ko Ruahine te maunga, 

Ko Rangitikei te awa,

Ko Kurahaupo te waka,

Ko Ngati Apa te iwi,

Ko Ngati Kauae te hapu,

Ko Parewanui te marae,

No Whanganui ahau,

Ko Jay Tihema toku ingoa

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the fundamentals of open source and how it might benefit local and global communities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on supporting pathways into the tech space such as mentoring, and keen to learn from anyone willing to share their time and experience.
